              Steak bites with white rice - Jiang's kitchen, NYC
            </p>
            <p>
              The meat and rice was a simple yet delicious combo. The steak bites were tender and melting with every bite. The subtle spices with the onions really boosted the flavor elavating the simple meal. Although we aim to try extravagant and new dishes when we tend to eat at restaurants, however, this steak and rice dish checks all the boxes for a satisfying and nutritious meal.

              Hand rolled noodles - Jiang's Kitchn, NYC
            </p>

              Where are my ramen addicts? I myself am guilty for indulging in the convenient pack of noodles. It's quick and easy AND unhealthy. Well, this dish is a much healthier alternative to our beloved 2 min noodles. These hand rolled noodles were a flavor explosion! I am still wondering how these noodles were able to absorb all the flavor from the sauce and spices. The vegetables still held their crunch and the sauce was sweet yet savory. This labor intensive dish is worth every penny. Not only does is it better than processed packet noodles, it contains quality ingredients. Next time you're craving your guilty pleasure give this hand rolled noodle a try!

              Crispy chicken over grilled vegetables - Invasion, TX
            </p>
            <p>
              I hate fried chicken! Said no one ever... This may seem like an unhealthy indulgence, but wait. There's veggies!!! A cripsy chicken cutlet, brushed in a sweet/spicy sauce layered over grilled brocoli, zucchini, bell peppers and onions. This may seem like a weird combination for a lot of people. But, don't knock it till you try it. The sweet and spicy fried chicken is complemented very well with the grilled veggies. I don't know about you but when I am on my healthy kick I need my vegetables with every meal. If you're your looking for a well balanced dish, this is it. P.S. This is a burger spot so one may stray away from a healthy chicken bowl. Happy eating :)

              Calling all noodle lovers!! (Again). This is the star of all soups (in my opinion). One of the things I adore about Thai cuisine is the simple ingredients and the punch of flavor. This noodle soup had a savory with a hint of sweet it the hearty broth. The soup consisted of 3 main ingredients, noodles, chicken breast, and sprouts. However, the lush flavor of the broth is what married all the ingredients together. I wish everyone is able to taste this once in their lifetime; it's definitely an experience! Arguably, Thai food can be considered unhealthy or be placed in the fast food category, but, it all comes down to the ingredients and how it's prepared. This dish was one of the healthier options I had explored, so if you're willing to give a it a try, you won't leave disatisfied.
